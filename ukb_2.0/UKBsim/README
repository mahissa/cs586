************************************************************************

This is a collection of scripts for performing graph-based lexical
similarity/relatedness using a pre-existing knowledge base. The
details of the method are described in [1]. The collection comprises
two Perl scripts, and depends on the correct instalation of UKB:

* similarity.pl:     computes similarity for pairs of words
                     using ukb_ppv

* similarity.pre.pl: computes similarity for pairs of words 
                     based on precalculated probability vectors
                     (see corresponding release in
                     http://ixa2.si.ehu.es/ukb)

* Similarity.pm:     provides some vector-similarity formulae
