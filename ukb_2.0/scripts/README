This directory contains scripts for converting WordNet from the original
format to UKB format. There are two scripts:

* wnindex2ukbdict.pl for creating the dictionary. It asks for the
  index.sense file in the WordNet distribution. Usage:

  ./wnindex2ukbdict.pl [-v] index.sense
       -v               Be verbose

* wndb2ukbrel.pl for creating the graph. It needs all the files under the
  dict/ directory of WordNet distribution. Usage:

 ./wndb2ukbrel.pl [-s src_name] [-d] [-v] wn_data_file1 ...
	-s source_name	Name of the source
	-d		Create a directed graph
	-v		Be verbose

* Example
